# Pillars

An unusually hard-to-learn card game for 2 players.

## Setup

Shuffle the deck and give each player seven cards. The player who didn't deal the cards starts.

## Card values

Aces are worth 1. Face cards (Jack, Queen and King) are worth different values depending on their position.

## Zones

In the middle of the table both players have a battle zone for each suit. These are ordered from closest to the deck to the furthest away from it: Hearts, Spades, Diamonds, Clubs.

Behind every battle zone on each player's side of the table is the scoring zone for the corresponding suit. Behind these zones each player has a fifth scoring zone for face cards.

## Turn structure

On your turn you can perform one action out of the following:

### Attack

Play cards in a suit that is not currently engaged in a battle (that battle zone is empty). This starts a new battle for the suit. You can attack with as many cards as you want as long as the total sum of the cards do not exceed 15 plus the number of scored Spades you have (not counting face cards).

*Example: You have scored two spades. Now you can play an attack of a total sum of 17, for example 7 of Diamonds and 10 of Diamonds.*

The face cards always has the value equal to the highest card you play in the attack.

*Example: You attack with a Queen, a 2 and a 6. The queen gets the value 6 so the total value of the cards is 6 + 6 + 2 = 14.*

Note that to win battles you want to have the most cards on your side, their value doesn't matter (low cards are easier to win with since they can more easily fit under the value limit).

### Defend

Defending works just like attacking but you play a suit that is already engaged in a battle. Place your cards on your side of the table in the correct battle zone.

### Crawl

This means that you can add a card to an attacking/defending pile while ignoring their value (you can go above a total value of 15 + the number of scored Spades).

### Score

When you score you check all piles where you have the most cards. Those are your winning  piles and you get to take one card from each of them *on either side of the battle*. This means that you can snatch a high value card from the opposing side if you want. Discard all other cards (on both sides) in the battles that you have won. These suits are now left open for new attacks.

Battles where there is a tie (same amount of cards) or the other player has the most cards are left as-is.

The cards you have won are placed in the scoring area at the back of your side of the table. 1 - 10 are grouped with their respective suit and face cards are placed in a fifth separate pile (their suit is ignored).

### Harvest

Draw cards equal to the number of Clubs you have scored.

### Perform magic

Discard a card from one of your piles of scored cards. Depending on what pile the card was in different things happen:

* Hearts - you can perform two additional actions this turn.
* Jack - Discard a card that the opponent has scored
* Queen - Draw three cards at random from the opponent's hand and add them to your hand
* King - Discard all cards from a battle of your choice

## End of turn
When the player is done with her action(s) she draws a new card from the deck and then passes the turn to the other player. If at this point the deck is out of cards the game is over and 'scoring' begins.

Scoring
----

Count the number of points in each pile (one for each color plus the one with face cards). The player with the most majorities wins. In the case of a tie, the player with majority in diamonds wins.
