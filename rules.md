# Pillars

An unusually hard-to-learn card game for 2 players.

## Setup

Shuffle the deck and give each player seven cards. The player who didn't deal the cards starts.

## Overview



## Turn structure

On your turn you can perform one action out of the following:

### Attack

Play cards in a suit that is not currently engaged in a battle. This starts a new battle for this color. You can play as many cards as you want as long as the total sum of the cards do not exceed 15 + the number of scored Spades you have.

	Example: You have scored two spades. Now you can play an attack of a total sum of 	17, for example 7 of Diamonds and 10 of Diamonds.



### Defend

### Crawl

### Score

### Harvest

### Perform magic

Discard a card from one of your piles of scored cards. Depending on what pile the card was in different things happen:

* Hearts - you can perform two additional actions this turn.
* Jack - Discard a card that the opponent has scored
* Queen - Steal three cards at random from the opponent's hand
* King - Discard all cards from a battle

## End of turn
When the player is done with her action(s) she draws a new card from the deck and then passes the turn to the other player. If at this point the deck is out of cards the game is over and 'scoring' begins.

Scoring
----

Count the number of points in each pile (one for each color plus the one with face cards). The player with the most majorities wins. In the case of a tie, the player with majority in diamonds wins.
