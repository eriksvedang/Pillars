# Pillars

An unusually hard-to-learn card game for 2 players.

## Setup

Shuffle the deck and give each player seven cards. The player who didn't deal the cards starts.

## Card values

Aces are worth 1. Face cards (Jack, Queen and King) are worth different values depending on their position.

## Turn structure

On your turn you can perform one action out of the following:

### Attack

Play cards in a suit that is not currently engaged in a battle. This starts a new battle for this color. You can play as many cards as you want as long as the total sum of the cards do not exceed 15 + the number of scored Spades you have (not counting face cards).

*Example: You have scored two spades. Now you can play an attack of a total sum of 17, for example 7 of Diamonds and 10 of Diamonds.*

The face cards always has the value equal to the highest card you play in the attack.

*Example: You attack with a Queen, a 2 and a 6 of Hearts. The queen gets the value 6 so the total value of the cards is 6 + 6 + 2 = 14.*

Note that to win battles you want to have the most cards on your side, their value doesn't matter (low cards are easier to win with since they can more easily fit under the value limit).

### Defend

Defending works just like attack but you play a color that is already on the table. Align your pile of defending cards with the attacking one.

### Crawl

This means that you can add a card to an attacking/defending pile while ignoring their value (you can go above a total value of 15 + the number of scored spades).

### Score

When you score you check all piles where you have the most cards. Those are your winning  piles and you get to take one card from each of them *on either side of the battle*. That means you can snatch a high value card from the opposing side if you want. Discard all other cards (on both sides) in each battle you won. These colors are now left open for a new attack.

Battles where there is a tie or the other player has the most cards are left as-is.

The cards you have won are placed in the scoring area at the back of your side of the table. 1 - 10 are placed in their respective suit and face cards are placed in a fifth separate pile (their suit is ignored).

### Harvest

### Perform magic

Discard a card from one of your piles of scored cards. Depending on what pile the card was in different things happen:

* Hearts - you can perform two additional actions this turn.
* Jack - Discard a card that the opponent has scored
* Queen - Steal three cards at random from the opponent's hand
* King - Discard all cards from a battle

## End of turn
When the player is done with her action(s) she draws a new card from the deck and then passes the turn to the other player. If at this point the deck is out of cards the game is over and 'scoring' begins.

Scoring
----

Count the number of points in each pile (one for each color plus the one with face cards). The player with the most majorities wins. In the case of a tie, the player with majority in diamonds wins.
